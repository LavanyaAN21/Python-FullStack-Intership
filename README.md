# Full Stack Python Developer Internship
This repository contains the work I completed during my Full Stack Python Developer Internship, where I focused on developing a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies. The internship was structured over 50 days, with specific focus on different technologies in each phase:

- Days 1-10: HTML & CSS
- Days 11-30: JavaScript
- Days 31-40: SQL
- Days 41-50: Python


## Internship Breakdown
### Days 1-10: HTML & CSS
During the first 10 days, I focused on mastering the basics of HTML and CSS. The main tasks included:

- Building static web pages with HTML to structure content.
- Styling the web pages using CSS and ensuring responsiveness through media queries.
- Learning how to create layouts using Flexbox and Grid.

### Key Skills Learned:
- Structuring web content using HTML tags.
- Responsive web design techniques.
- Advanced styling concepts using CSS.

### Days 11-30: JavaScript
In the next 20 days, I focused on enhancing front-end development skills with JavaScript. Key tasks included:
- Adding interactivity to web pages through JavaScript, such as form validation, user input handling, and dynamic content rendering.
- Learning how to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model).
- Implementing basic algorithms and logic using JavaScript.

### Key Skills Learned:
- DOM manipulation and event handling.
- Writing efficient JavaScript code.
- Working with functions, loops, and conditional statements.

### Days 31-40: SQL
The following 10 days were dedicated to learning SQL. During this phase, I worked on:
- Understanding relational databases and their structure.
- Writing SQL queries to interact with databases, including basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- Designing simple databases and optimizing queries for better performance.

### Key Skills Learned:
- SQL query writing (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- Database design and normalization.
- Joining tables and working with relational data.

### Days 41-50: Python
In the final 10 days, I transitioned to learning Python for back-end development. Tasks included:
- Writing Python scripts for server-side logic.
- Integrating Python with SQL for database operations.
- Developing simple web applications using Python-based frameworks like Flask or Django (if applicable).

### Key Skills Learned:
Python syntax and basic programming concepts.
Writing Python scripts for server-side logic.
Integrating databases with Python.

### Technologies Used
- HTML: Structuring web content.
- CSS: Styling and responsive web design.
- JavaScript: Adding interactivity and dynamic functionality.
- SQL: Database management and queries.
- Python: Server-side programming and web application development.

This internship helped me develop a comprehensive understanding of full-stack development, with hands-on experience in building dynamic and data-driven web applications. I gained essential skills for both front-end and back-end technologies, setting a strong foundation for future web development projects.
